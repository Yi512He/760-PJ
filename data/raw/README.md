<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>

<p>As the public data is increasing overtime, it is impossible to download the version of the raw data we used in this experiment. </p>

<p>We downloaded the data at Oct.29 2020. And the size of raw data is 484.5MB, which is too large and unnecessary to include in this repository. </p>

<p>Hence, we do not include the <code>Python script</code> to process the raw data.</p>

<p>However, we have included the scheme we use to trim the raw data and explain this process well in the report.</p>
