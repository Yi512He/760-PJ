<ol>
<li>Model 1: logistic regression</li>
<li>Model 2: balanced random forest</li>
<li>Model 3: naive bayes</li>
</ol>

<p>All three of the experiments are conducted under the <code>jupyter nodebook</code> computation interactive environment.</p>
<p>To run each of the experiment, please go to each sub directory and follow the instruction on README.</p>
<p>Note that, different experiment might require different versions of <code>Python</code> or different packages. </p>
<p>Different models might have different encoding scheme.</p>
